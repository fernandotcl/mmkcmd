## Introduction

mmkcmd is a simple utility for OS X that maps multimedia keys to commands specified on the command line. This can be particurly useful in combination with music players such as [Cmus][], but mmkcmd can also be used to simply prevent iTunes from launching when the multimedia keys are pressed.

## Usage

Here's an example of how mmkcmd can be used in conjunction with Cmus in a script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

mmkcmd -p 'cmus-remote -u' -f 'cmus-remote -n' -r 'cmus-remote -r' &
MMKCMD_PID=$!

/usr/local/bin/cmus

kill $MMKCMD_PID
```

All possible command line switches are documented in `mmkcmd(1)`.
